## Project Description:

This was our final project for IE498-High Frequency Trading under professor [David Lariviere](https://david.web.illinois.edu) . We developed an orderbook-based mini-exchange using the programming language Rust. The program consists of four primary applications: a gateway, an order matching engine, a dropcopy, and a market data ticker plant, as well as client machines to interact with the exchange.

Traders connect directly to the gateway using TCP to send orders and receive order updates. Currently traders input orders using a basic command line interface. After the order is submitted, it is sent to the Gateway where we validate the information contained in the order. If it is valid, the trade is sent to the order matching engine using UDP multicast. The matching engine receives orders and determines if the incoming order matches with any resting orders on the book. If no trades can be executed, and the incoming order is a limit order, we rest the order on the orderbook. Otherwise we use the gateway to send information back to the client indicating that the trade was not executed. The tickerplant publishes public market data using UDP multicast whenever a trade is executed. The dropcopy aggregates all private market data related to a single company and sends it to the main trader/client from the company.

## Technologies:

In order to develop and build our exchange we utilized a variety of technologies. The main technologies we used included Rust, CI/CD & RPI, UFW Firewall, Vagrant & VM, and Git.

### Rust:

In order to develop a fast and efficient system we decided to choose a systems programming language. We chose Rust as our primary development language instead of C or C++ as Rust is a newer language that has been becoming increasingly popular among developers and we wanted to gain more experience using it in a project.

### CI/CD & RPI:

CI/CD is useful because it allows us to automate testing when new code changes are made to our project during development. As new code is pushed, it is regularly built, tested, and merged to the repository. Our CI/CD server is externally set up on a Raspberry Pi instead of using a cloud provider such as AWS because it was cheaper to run 24/7 and one of our group members had an extra Raspberry Pi.

### UFW Firewall:

Because we wanted to connect our Pi to this project for at least the duration of the semester, we needed to find a way to make it more secure. We chose to create a firewall using Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) because it was easy to set up. As of May 16th 2022, the firewall is configured to accept only SSH connections from our IP addresses and connect to GitLab.

### Vagrant & VM:

We decided to use virtual machines (VMs) for each component of our project because we wanted our system architecture to be as similar to a real world exchange as possible. The virtual machines ran a slightly modified version of CentOS that was designed to use minimal compute resources. We chose to use this operating system because our professor made it publically available to our class.

In order to simplify VM creation and management we used a software called Vagrant. Vagrant allows us to automate the creation of virtual machines and simplifies the process of managing and configuring a set of VMs.

### Git:

We choose to use git as our version control software (VCS) because it is the most commonly used VCS in industry. Version control software is important because it allows us to split the workload and collaborate efficiently.

## Components:

#### Gateway:

The gateway is the middle-man between the clients and the rest of the exchange. Clients communicate with the gateway to send orders and receive updates on submitted orders. The clients and gateway communicate via the transfer control protocol (TCP).  TCP is a reliable protocol (meaning dropped packets are automatically retransmitted), packets are ordered, and is unicast (one to one only). TCP is ideal for this component of the exchange compared to UDP as we can not have packets being dropped and need to ensure the ordering of trades.

### Client:
The client represents a single trader submitting orders to the exchange. They only interact with the gateway via TCP. Additionally all the clients have a UDP multicast listener to pick up packets from the ticker plant and dropcopy.

### Order Matching Engine:

The order matching engine receives the orders that were sent from the client through the gateway. It then utilizes an orderbook to determine if the order matches with any current resting orders and then adds that order to the order book and sends the result to the esb, dropcopy, and tickerplant.  An orderbook is an electronic list of buy and sell orders for a specific security or financial instrument organized by price level. Orderbook’s help improve market transparency as they provide information on price, availability, depth of trade, and who initiates transactions. The order matching engine utilizes UDP multicast to send packets reflecting changes to the order book to other internal components of the exchange simultaneously.



### Ticker Plant:

The market data ticker plant utilizes the information sent from the order matching engine and creates a market data book update message. The tickerplant data update message is sent using UDP multicast, to which multiple clients can connect to and ensure simultaneous receipt of market data to avoid providing unfair advantages to a few clients.  

### Dropcopy:

The dropcopy aggregates order and trade data for a single trading entity across all of its clients. The data that the gateway sends to each client is replicated in a single stream to a single machine, often used as a kill switch system at the broker-dealer. For example, one broker-dealer that has 10 different trading desks, each with its own connection to the gateway, can have a single back-office system that receives data from the dropcopy, to provide a holistic view of all of their trades.

## Git Repo Layout:

- On the main branch, src/ has all of our code
- Everything is run from src/main.rs
- In order to run our project you must have cargo, rust, and vagrant installed locally on your computer.
- All other branches contain code that is being worked and should not be used to run any part of the project.

## Instructions to Run Project:

First clone our repository using 
- `git clone https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/ie598_high_frequency_trading_spring_2022/ie498_hft_spring_2022_group_05/group_05_project.git` 

Then open the project directory using:
- `cd group-05-project`

To generate, provision, and turn on the VMs, run vagrant up. Make sure that VirtualBox or another VM manager is installed. We have already installed all the prerequisite software that the VMs need to run.
- `vagrant up`


To access a VM, we need to SSH into it. Open a new terminal for each entity in the Vagrantfile and ssh into the respective entity. Then clone or download our repository in EACH entity. This clone can be done using the above `git clone` command. 


To run a specific entity, we can provide command line arguments that specify the name of the VM. Below is an example of SSH’ing into a single VM and running that entity.

`vagrant status      # lists the names and statuses of all of the VMs`

`vagrant ssh gateway # ssh's into the gateway VM`

`cargo run gateway # actually runs the gateway` 

Make sure that each entity is up and running BEFORE you start the gateway. For the client specifically, there will be STDIN prompts that the user will need to provide to generate the orders. If you do not want to do this manually, you can create a simple python script that periodically pipes data into the STDIN of the client entity.

The VM names, as specified in the vagrant file, and the corresponding cargo run commands are as follows.

- gateway - cargo run gateway
- ome - cargo run ome
- dropcopy - cargo run dropcopy
- tickerplant - cargo run tickerplant
- trader1 - cargo run client
- trader2 - cargo run client
- trader3 - cargo run client

## Testing:
We also implemented a basic ci/cd pipeline that is able to run our test suite and maintain functionality of the project as we progressed throughout the course of the semester. For system/integration testing, we wrote a bash script to be run on the same machine as one of the clients, simulating a trading desk actually using the exchange.

## Project Results:
We accomplished building all of the components of an exchange, with various components networked together. The clients connect directly to the gateway using TCP to send their orders using a basic command line interface. After the order is submitted, it is sent to the gateway where we validate the order and send it forward to the order matching engine using UDP multicast. Note that as of May 16th, 2022 this UDP connection is not fully functional. The matching engine processes the order, attempting to match it with a resting order or otherwise placing limit orders on the book (if it’s a market order that can’t be executed, an error message is sent back to the client). After executing the trade, information about the trade is broadcast over UDP multicast to the tickerplant and dropcopy. The tickerplant then publishes public market data using UDP multicast to clients, and the dropcopy aggregates all private market data related to a single company and sends it to the main trader/client from the company. The tickerplant also broadcasts data updates when the BBO changes.

**2. What did you learn as a result of doing your project?**
   - Gained familiarity with Rust
   - Gained a strong understanding networking concepts and experience with network programming.
   - Better understanding of CI/CD and the importance of thorough testing.

**3. If you had a time machine and could go back to the beginning, what would you have done differently?**
   - Communicated more clearly with group members so that we could finish the project within the semester.
   - I would have started programming the UDP connections earlier, leaving my groupmates to flush out more of the basic logic.

   - Create a client interface that is easier to use than command line input
   - Setup network monitoring to be able to be able to track an order from one end of the system end to the other end (submitting an order -> filling it -> getting info back to client).
   This would help us realize what parts of our system are slow.
   - Gateway OME completion
   - More Unit Testing & System integration testing

**5. What advice do you offer to future students taking this course and working on their semester-long project (besides “start earlier”... everyone ALWAYS says that). Providing detailed thoughtful advice to future students will be weighed heavily in evaluating your responses.**
   - Personally, I think there no need to start earlier. It is more important to manage expectations and make sure people are on top of their assigned tasks on a weekly basis. If some teammates are consistently not meeting deadlines then it is vital to quickly step in and finish there work so that the project can be finished according to your timeline.
   - Honestly evaluate group member skill sets when deciding project and work allocation. Then spread your workload evenly. Note that this does not mean everyone gets equal work. I think people with more experience should be able to handle slightly more work.
   - Take time to evaluate potential technologies and their tradeoffs. For example, we could have used Python for our project instead of Rust. Python is a rather slow language with less control over underlying hardware. It also abstracts many features which reduces the amount that programmers have to learn. On the other hand, Rust development takes longer but there is opportunity to learn more about underlying features.
   - Hold group members accountable! It is important to check-in early and often with teammates who are not meeting expectations.

### Aman Khinvasara Post-Mortem
**1. What did you specifically do individually for this project?**
   - Collaborated on overall exchange design
   - Dropcopy
   - Gateway order validation logic
   - Bash script for integration testing
   - Final Report

**2. What did you learn as a result of doing your project?**
   - I developed a much more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the internal workings of an exchange, and about the complexity and edge cases involved. Particularly with regulation - for example, considering if the OME prevents wash trading
   - Making the concrete tradeoffs between TCP, UDP unicast, and UDP multicast for various interactions between components
   - Using Vagrant and VirtualBox to configure and provision virtual machines on their own subnet
   - An introduction to programming in Rust and the differences between rust and other languages I am familiar with using

**3. If you had a time machine and could go back to the beginning, what would you have done differently?**
   - Should have begun a lot earlier, and done more groundwork at the beginning to understand the real demands and difficulties of the project. For example, we thought the primary weight of the project would be in designing and implementing the logic for each of the components, and severely underestimated the difficulty of the networking aspect.
   - Set more concrete deadlines for various components and actually hold each other accountable to them

**4. If you were to continue working on this project, what would you continue to do to improve it, how, and why?**
   - Complete the client-level bash script to perform system/integration testing, and integrate that into the CI/CD pipeline. This was begun but not completed due to time constraints
   - Complete end-to-end automation of exchange setup, such as startup scripts on each of the VMs
   - Many of the aspects of the exchange were simplified. Would have added OME functionality to actually use incoming data such as the ticker symbol and if orders can be partially filled. Would have supported multiple assets.
   - Adding redundancy with multiple OMEs and other components
   - Create an API for the client side that could be used to perform algorithmic trading on top of our exchange

**5. What advice do you offer to future students taking this course and working on their semester-long project (besides “start earlier”... everyone ALWAYS says that). Providing detailed thoughtful advice to future students will be weighed heavily in evaluating your responses.**

- Think very carefully and ask a lot of questions about the different aspects of the project, and the difficulty and time associated with each of them
- Meet early and meet often for work sessions, which creates accountability and helps raise and discuss a lot of the system-level questions (i.e. How are we going to handle XYZ, or communicate between A and B?”)
- Setup a complete dev environment as soon as possible and set aside blocks of time for initial on-ramping, particularly if you are using technologies with which you are not already familiar
